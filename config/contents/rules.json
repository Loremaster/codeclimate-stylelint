So both of the following `.foo` rules have a nesting depth of 2, and will therefore pass if your `max` is less than or equal to 2:\n\n```css\na {\n  b { /* 1 */\n    .foo {} /* 2 */\n  }\n}\n\n@media print { /* ignored */\n  a {\n    b { /* 1 */\n      .foo {} /* 2 */\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis rule integrates into stylelint's core the functionality of the (now deprecated) plugin [`stylelint-statement-max-nesting-depth`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/stylelint-statement-max-nesting-depth).\n\n",

  "no-descending-specificity": "# no-descending-specificity\n\nDisallow selectors of lower specificity from coming after overriding selectors of higher specificity.\n\n```css\n    #container a { top: 10px; } a { top: 0; }\n/** ↑                           ↑\n * The order of these selectors represents descending specificity */\n```\n\nSource order is important in CSS, and when two selectors have the *same* specificity, the one that occurs *last* will take priority. However, the situation is different when one of the selectors has a *higher* specificity. In that case, source order does *not* matter: the selector with higher specificity will win out even if it comes first.\n\nThe clashes of these two mechanisms for prioritization, source order and specificity, can cause some confusion when reading stylesheets. If a selector with higher specificity comes *before* the selector it overrides, we have to think harder to understand it, because it violates the source order expectation. **Stylesheets are most legible when overriding selectors always come *after* the selectors they override.** That way both mechanisms, source order and specificity, work together nicely.\n\nThis rule enforces that practice *as best it can*. (It cannot catch every *actual* overriding selector (because it does not know the DOM structure, for one), but it can catch certain common mistakes.)\n\nHere's how it works: **This rule looks at the last *compound selector* in every full selector, and then compares it with other selectors in the stylesheet that end in the same way.**\n\nSo `.foo .bar` (whose last compound selector is `.bar`) will be compared to `.bar` and `#baz .bar`, but not to `#baz .foo` or `.bar .foo`.\n\nAnd `a > li#wag.pit` (whose last compound selector is `li#wag.pit`) will be compared to `div li#wag.pit` and `a > b > li + li#wag.pit`, but not to `li`, or `li #wag`, etc.\n\nThere's one other important feature: Selectors targeting pseudo-elements are not considered comparable to similar selectors without the pseudo-element, because they target other elements on the rendered page. For example, `a::before {}` will not be compared to `a:hover {}`, because `a::before` targets a pseudo-element whereas `a:hover` targets the actual `<a>`.\n\nThis rule only compares rules that are within the same media context. So `a {} @media print { #baz a {} }` is fine.\n\nThis rule resolves nested selectors before calculating the specificity of the selectors.\n\n",
  "no-duplicate-selectors": "# no-duplicate-selectors\n\nDisallow duplicate selectors within a stylesheet.\n\n```css\n    .foo {} .bar {} .foo {}\n/** ↑              ↑\n * These duplicates */\n```\n\nThis rule checks for two types of duplication:\n\n-   Duplication of a single selector with a rule's selector list, e.g. `a, b, a {}`.\n-   Duplication of a selector list within a stylesheet, e.g. `a, b {} a, b {}`. Duplicates are found even if the selectors come in different orders or have different spacing, e.g. `a d, b > c {} b>c, a   d {}`.\n\nThe same selector *is* allowed to repeat in the following circumstances:\n\n-   It is used in different selector lists, e.g. `a {} a, b {}`.\n-   The duplicates are determined to originate in different stylesheets, e.g. you have concatenated or compiled files in a way that produces sourcemaps for PostCSS to read, e.g. postcss-import).\n-   The duplicates are in rules with different parent nodes, e.g. inside and outside of a media query.\n\nThis rule resolves nested selectors. So `a b {} a { & b {} }` counts as a warning, because the resolved selectors end up with a duplicate.\n\n",

Instead of having 5 shades of pale light blue, for example, you probably wanted just one,\n\nFor more details about how css-colorguard works, please read [that module's documentation](https://github.com/SlexAxton/css-colorguard).\n\nBugs and feature requests should be reported on the [css-colorguard issue tracker](https://github.com/SlexAxton/css-colorguard/issues).\n\n",

That's because an `@if { ... }` statement can be successfully parsed as an at-rule with a block. You might also want to set `\"ignoreAtRules\": [\"else\"]` for another stylelint's core rule - [`at-rule-empty-line-before`](http://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/at-rule-empty-line-before/) that could be forcing empty lines before at-rules (including `@else`s that follow `@if`s or other `@else`s).\n\nThis rule doesn't have usual `\"always\"` and `\"never\"` main option values, because if you don't need special behavior for `@if` and `@else` you could just use [`block-closing-brace-newline-after`](http://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/block-closing-brace-newline-after/) set to `\"always\"` or any other value.\n\n",
